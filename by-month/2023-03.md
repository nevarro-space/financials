# March 2023

## Commentary

This month was fairly expensive due to buying a yearly subscription to
UptimeRobot. The amortized monthly rate when paid annually is $29, which is $5
less than the monthly option, so this saves $60/yr.

It was also the first full month of hosting
[mineshspc.com](https://mineshspc.com) on Nevarro LLC infrastructure. I'm
running one node for the website itself, and then a monitoring node which runs
Grafana + Loki. I will not need to provision additional monitoring nodes when I
add additional resources to the cluster, so that expense should be stable.

## Equity

At the end of the month, the total equity of Nevarro LLC was **$1,037.90**. This
is down $363.53 from the $1,401.43 at the end of February.

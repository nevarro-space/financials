## Commentary

This month, I got my first revenue outside of my personal capital contributions!
This means that for the first month ever, Nevarro was profitable.

I got a tutoring student at $50/hr and made a total of $270.00 from that
student. I spent $17.58 for accepting the job on Tutors.com, and I spent $26.27
to book a room at Connects Workspace for the initial consultation. I also spent
$6.25 in Square fees.

In addition, I cut the cost of my Matrix server from €37.90/mo to €13.10/mo.
This cost-savings will be seen in the bill for February which will post in May,
as I made the change fairly late in the month. This will reduce my monthly
server costs by ~$25.

# May 2023

## Commentary

The unexpected cost from last month of Twilio Sendgrid continued since I needed
to continue sending lots of emails for HSPC. I did cancel the plan, so we are
back to the 100/month plan until more registrations start happening.

I also moved to a new house, so I had to change the address of the business to
my new residence. Due to this, I had to pay a few fees to the Colorado Secretary
of State and USPS for the address change.

I also purchased matrixexporter.com for a potential future project.

## Equity

At the end of the month, the total equity of Nevarro LLC was **$883.31**. This

organize server costs with the month they were incurred.

# April 2023

## Commentary

Two domain renewals came in this month and I started migrating my Matrix server
to Nevarro infrastructure.

An unexpected cost this month was Twilio Sendgrid. I ran out of free emails on
the mineshspc.com site as the HSPC competition approached, so I had to upgrade
the plan to enable sending more emails.

## Equity

At the end of the month, the total equity of Nevarro LLC was **$995.54**. This
is down $42.36 from the $1,037.90 at the end of February.

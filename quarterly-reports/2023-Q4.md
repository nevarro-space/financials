# Quarterly Report for Q4 2023

This is the financial summary for Nevarro LLC in Q4 of 2023. Most of the quarter
was quiet with the primary costs being maintaining servers. However, the end of
December saw a flurry of activity with a few yearly subscriptions coming due.

## Equity

No revenue was generated, and $319.81 of expenses were incurred.

| **Summary**  |         |
| :----------- | ------: |
| **Revenue**  |   $0.00 |
| **Expenses** | $319.81 |
| **Equity**   | $355.69 |

The total equity is **down $334.88** since last quarter.

The equity breakdown is as follows:

| **Assets**            |             | **Liabilities**       |             |
| :-------------------- | ----------: | :-------------------- | ----------: |
| **Bluevine Checking** |     $539.08 | **Chase Credit Card** |     $183.39 |
| **TOTAL**             | **$539.08** | **TOTAL**             | **$183.39** |

## Runway Calculation

This quarter, the burn rate was $107/mo. At this burn rate, Nevarro LLC has two
months of runway. However, the early part of the year will require incurring
costs from multiple annual subscriptions, so this runway is quite generous.

Nevarro LLC will need another infusion of cash in January to remain solvent.

## 2024 Q1 Budget

In the coming three months, the server costs are estimated to stay stable at the
December levels.

Multiple domain renewals and transfers will occur (I'm centralizing all of the
domain registrations in Namecheap at ~$20/yr)

| **Line Item**                               |  **Amount** |
| :------------------------------------------ | ----------: |

| Domain Renewals/Transfers ($22 * 6 domains) |     $132.00 |
| UptimeRobot.com                             |     $350.00 |

# Quarterly Report for Q3 2024

This is the financial summary for Nevarro LLC in Q3 of 2024. I opened a new line
of business which is a contract position to help manage the martial arts school
I'm a member of.

## Equity

A total of $500.00 in revenue was generated, and $195.38 of expenses were
incurred.

| **Summary**  |           |
| :----------- | --------: |
| **Revenue**  |   $500.00 |
| **Expenses** |   $195.38 |
| **Equity**   | $1,804.79 |

At the end of the quarter, the total equity of Nevarro LLC was **$1,909.99**.

## Runway Calculation

The management contract was a one-off, so will be ignored for the runway
calculation.

This quarter, the burn rate was $66/mo. At this burn rate, Nevarro LLC has 29
months of runway. However, many of my subscriptions are due in Q1 and not as
many are due in Q3, so this number is somewhat skewed.

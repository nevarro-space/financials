# Quarterly Report for Q2 2024

This is the financial summary for Nevarro LLC in Q2 of 2024. Nothing of interest
happened during Q2.

## Equity

No revenue was generated, and $820.90 of expenses were incurred.

| **Summary**  |           |
| :----------- | --------: |
| **Revenue**  |     $0.00 |
| **Expenses** |   $199.61 |
| **Equity**   | $1,804.79 |

At the end of the month, the total equity of Nevarro LLC was **$1,249.49**.

(Skipping equity breakdown due to this being retroactive and I don't know
exactly what the breakdown was.)

## Runway Calculation

This quarter, the burn rate was $67/mo. At this burn rate, Nevarro LLC has 26
months of runway. However, many of my subscriptions are due in Q1 and not as
many are due in Q2, so this number is somewhat skewed.

## 2024 Q3 Budget

(skipping due to doing this retroactively, I knew that Q3 wouldn't incur many
costs, so I didn't bother budgeting)

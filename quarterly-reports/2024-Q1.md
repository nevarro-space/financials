# Quarterly Report for Q1 2024

This is the financial summary for Nevarro LLC in Q1 of 2024. I generated revenue
apart from capital contributions for the first time, and I also put another $2k
into the business via a capital contribution.

## Equity

A total of $270.00 in revenue was generated, and $820.90 of expenses were
incurred. The budget for this quarter was $741. The main overage was due to
paying for Twilio (~$20/mo) and adding a GitHub donation for GoatCounter.

## Runway Calculation

This quarter, the burn rate was $274/mo. At this burn rate, Nevarro LLC has six
months of runway. However, many of the annual subscription costs were incurred
this quarter, so burn for next quarter is expected to be lower.

## 2024 Q2 Budget

Server costs will be reduced to around $35/mo due to downsizing the main Matrix
instance.

Multiple domain renewals and transfers will occur (I'm centralizing all of the
domain registrations in Namecheap at ~$20/yr)

| **Line Item**               |  **Amount** |
| :-------------------------- | ----------: |
| Hetzner ($35.00/mo)         |     $105.00 |
| Backblaze ($15.00/mo)       |      $45.00 |
| GitHub Donation ($5.30/mo)  |      $15.90 |
| Twilio Sendgrid ($19.95/mo) |      $59.85 |
| **TOTAL**                   | **$225.75** |

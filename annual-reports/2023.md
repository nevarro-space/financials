# Nevarro LLC 2023 Annual Report

This year was Nevarro LLC's first year of existence. Formed in January and
funded with an initial capital contribution of $1,500.00 from Sumner Evans in
January, Nevarro LLC proceeded to spend down that initial capital contribution
over the course of the year at an average rate of $95.36/mo.

Monitoring costs were the largest expenditure, followed closely by server costs.
Next year, the server costs will most likely outpace the monitoring costs, since
the server costs increased over the year to about $80/mo while the monitoring
costs will stay stable around $40/mo.

Domains and email services collectively came out to under $150 for the year, but
that number is going to go up due to some domain renewals for domains that were
not initially under Nevarro LLC.

Next year, Nevarro LLC will attempt to operate at a burn rate of under $150/mo
($1,800 for the year). This should be achievable, as estimated cost of doing
business are about $135/mo.

## Revenue Generation Opportunities

Nevarro LLC's tutoring wing has not gained much traction (a few leads have been
generated through Tutors.com, but none so far have worked out). My goal for this
year is to get one student and generate $100.00 in revenue from tutoring.

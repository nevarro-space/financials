$100.00 of tutoring revenue. I achieved this goal, however it seems like it was
a one-off event.

## Expenses

Nevarro incurred $1,375.77 of expenses throughout the year for an average of
$114.65/mo. This is under the estimated cost of doing business of $135/mo, and
well under the budgeted $150/mo target.

Costs associated with maintaining Nevarro's online presence and server
infrastructure were was the largest category of expenditure. General server
costs, monitoring services, email services, and domains accounted for 97% of the
expenses incurred by the company.

directly for every dollar of revenue generated, or alternatively $14.40 of

## Equity

At the end of 2023, Nevarro LLC had equity of **$355.69**.

At the end of the year, the equity of Nevarro LLC was **$1,849.88**.

This is an _increase_ of _$1,494.19_.

## Plans for 2025

For the first time in its history, I anticipate that Nevarro will not require a
capital contribution for the calendar year 2025. Current equity is already
greater than anticipated expenditures. Additionally, if revenue goals are met,
Nevarro will end calendar year 2025 with around $800.00 of equity.

### Revenue Goals

Since I am no longer teaching in any capacity (either as adjunct or TA) at
Mines, I'm going to set a goal of at least two students and at least $500.00 of
revenue from tutoring.

### Expense Goals

Next year, Nevarro LLC will attempt to operate at a budget of $125/mo
($1,500 for the year). This should be achievable, as estimated cost of doing
business is about $115/mo.

The targets for each category of expenditure are as follows:

| **Category**                          |    **Amount** |
| :------------------------------------ | ------------: |
| Server Costs                          |       $485.00 |
| Monitoring Services                   |       $405.00 |
| Email Services                        |       $255.00 |
| Domains                               |       $200.00 |
| Cost of Revenue (at $0.07 per dollar) |        $35.00 |
| Business Maintenance Expenses         |        $10.00 |
| _Buffer_                              |       $110.00 |
